## 🧠 Core Concepts

* `Chatroom`: A conversation space containing messages and participants
* `ChatParticipant`: A polymorphic link between your models and a chatroom
* `Message`: A message sent by a participant in a chatroom
* `IsChatParticipant` Trait: Add to any model to enable chat behavior

---

## ✅ Requirements

* PHP 8.0+
* Laravel 11+

---

## ✨ Quick Example

```php
$message = $user->sendMessageTo($otherUser, "Hello!");
$reply = $otherUser->sendMessageTo($user, "Hi back!");
```

Easily send messages to:

* Individual users
* Multiple recipients
* Entire chatrooms
* Non-model participants (bots, services, etc.)

## 🔥 Why Not Chatify?

Unlike [Chatify](https://github.com/munafio/chatify), Le Chat **does not limit messages to one sender and one recipient**. This package supports:

* Multi-participant chatrooms
* Flexible polymorphic model support
* Bots and non-DB participants
